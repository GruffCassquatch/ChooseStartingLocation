# Choose Starting Location
Allows you to choose your starting location when starting a new Sandbox game. 
The idea is to add more variety and to allow better roleplaying/storytelling options. 
It is designed to work alongside my other mods [ChooseStartingGear](https://github.com/GruffCassquatch/ChooseStartingGear) and [ChooseStartingCondition](https://github.com/GruffCassquatch/ChooseStartingConditions) for a completely custom start.       

* You can choose your location even on Interloper!
* Includes ALL regions, not just the usual new game options
* All regions and locations are also available as Random options

## The mod will not work on Challenges or Story Mode, it is only for new Survival sandbox games.
